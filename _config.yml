# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  bio:
    " My name is Camille Duquesne and I teach computer science (for most hours the IB Diploma years). 
  Here you'll be able to find resources I use in my teaching and a few of my thoughts on my blogposts. 
  As I believe education should be free and accessible for all, none of my resources are behind a paywall. 
  If you like my content, feel free to leave a donation through buy me coffee :)"
