A1.1 Computer hardware and operation

A1.1.1 Describe the functions and interactions of the main CPU components.
• Units: arithmetic logic unit (ALU), control unit (CU)
• Registers: instruction register (IR), program counter (PC), memory address register (MAR), memory data
register (MDR), accumulator (AC)
• Buses: address, data, control
• Processors: single core processor, multi-core processor, co-processors
• A diagrammatic representation of the relationship between the specified CPU components

A1.1.2 Describe the role of a GPU.
• The architecture that allows graphics processing units (GPUs) to handle specific tasks and makes them
suitable for complex computations
• Real-world scenarios may include video games, artificial intelligence (AI), large simulations and other
applications that require graphics rendering and machine learning.

A1.1.3 Explain the differences between the CPU and the GPU. (HL only)
• Differences in their design philosophies, usage scenarios
• Differences in their core architecture, processing power, memory access, power efficiency
• CPUs and GPUs working together: task division, data sharing, coordinating execution

A1.1.4 Explain the purposes of different types of primary memory.
• Random-access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), cache (L1, L2, L3), registers
• The interaction of the CPU with different types of memory to optimize performance
• The relevance of the terms “cache miss” and “cache hit”

A1.1.5 Describe the fetch, decode and execute cycle.
• The basic operations a CPU performs to execute a single instruction in machine language
• The interaction between memory and registers via the three buses: address, data, control

A1.1.6 Describe the process of pipelining in multi-core architectures. (HL only)
• The instructions fetch, decode, execute
• Write-back stages to improve the overall system performance in multi-core architectures
• Overview of how cores in multi-core processors work independently and in parallel

A1.1.7 Describe internal and external types of secondary memory storage.
• Internal hard drives: solid state drive (SSD), hard disk drive (HDD), embedded multimedia cards
(eMMCs)
• External hard drives: SSD, HDD, optical drives, flash drives, memory cards, network attached storage
(NAS)
• The scenarios in which the various types of drive are used

A1.1.8 Describe the concept of compression.
• The differences between lossy compression methods and lossless compression methods
• Run-length encoding and transform coding

A1.1.9 Describe the different types of services in cloud computing.
• Services: software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
• The differences between the approaches of SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS in various real-world scenarios,
recognizing that different degrees of control and flexibility influence resource management and
resource availability
