## B2.4.1 Describe the efficiency of specific algorithms by calculating their Big O notation to analyse their scalability.

• The time and space complexities of algorithms and calculating Big O notation

• Algorithm choice based on scalability and efficiency requirements

## B2.4.2 Construct and trace algorithms to implement a linear search and a binary search for dataretrieval.

• The differences in efficiency between different methods of linear and binary search

• Use of search technique based on efficiency requirements—for example, searching a database for a sorted/indexed list of names to find a phone number, versus searching by the number to identify the name

## B2.4.3 Construct and trace algorithms to implement bubble sort and selection sort, evaluating their time and space complexities.

• The time and space complexities of each algorithm, denoted by their respective Big O notations

• The advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm in terms of efficiency across various data sets

## B2.4.4 Explain the fundamental concept of recursion and its applications in programming. (HL only)

• The fundamentals of recursion and its advantages and limitations

• The utility of recursion in solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-
problems

• Recursive algorithms, including but not limited to quicksort

• The limitations of recursion, including complexity and memory usage

• Situations that best suit the use of recursion, including fractal image creation, traversing binary trees,
sorting algorithms

## B2.4.5 Construct and trace recursive algorithms in a programming language. (HL only)

• Simple, non-branching recursive algorithms in programming only
